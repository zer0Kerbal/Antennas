	// Addon specific
		#ANTS-name = Antennas
		#ANTS-abbv = ANTS
		#ANTS-tags = ants )ant( hu6s hugs
		
	// Agencies
		#ANTS-Agency-titl = Phantom Aerospace
		#ANTS-Agency-desc = Phantom Aerospace was created by DTPhantom to help communicate over vast distances.

	// Compatibility
		#ANTS-tm-desc = Telemachus enhanced.
		#ANTS-rt-desc = RemoteTech enhanced.

	// Parts
		#ANTS-helixAntenna-titl = H1X "Helical Antenna"
		#ANTS-helixAntenna-desc = A Helical Antenna for long range communications.  Our engineers assure us that the gold and silver foil makes it "spacier".
		#ANTS-helixAntenna-tags = phantom aerospace vhf aerial antenna radio signal transmi

		#ANTS-hu6s125-titl = HU6S - 125 "Twin Loop" Antenna
		#ANTS-hu6s125-desc = An antenna designed to wrap around your 1.25m rocket and serve as an omni antenna.  It doesn't need to be deployed so you can use it in the atmosphere.  Also serves as a downlink for the Telemachus network.
		#ANTS-hu6s125-tags = phantom aerospace vhf aerial antenna radio signal transmi

		#ANTS-quadHelix-titl = Q4-4 "Quad Helix"
		#ANTS-quadHelix-desc = A Quadrifilar Helix Antenna, a good Omnidirectional antenna for starting your space program.  This unit is primarily designed to send Telemachus data back to your HQ but also allows a limited range Remote Tech connection.
		#ANTS-quadHelix-tags = phantom aerospace vhf aerial antenna radio signal transmi

		#ANTS-vhfBlade-titl = V17-7 "Scimitar" Antenna
		#ANTS-vhfBlade-desc = A low profile VHF Scimitar antenna compatible with the Telemachus data link system, as well as serving as a 300km omni antenna for Remote Tech.  Rumour has it these are left over from the Apollo Program where they served as VHF Communication Antennas.
		#ANTS-vhfBlade-tags = phantom aerospace vhf aerial antenna radio signal transmi

		#ANTS-yagiActual-titl = YA-6 "Yagi Antenna"
		#ANTS-yagiActual-desc = An actual Yagi Antenna, this antenna is perfect for keeping in contact with the inner solar system.  Also establishes data links with Telemachus Network.
		#ANTS-yagiActual-tags = phantom aerospace vhf aerial antenna radio signal transmi

		#ANTS-yagiAntenna-titl = LA7 "Log-Periodic"
		#ANTS-yagiAntenna-desc = A Log Periodic Antenna for mid range wide angle communications.  Though not as long ranged as traditional dish type antenna's this antenna has a wider angle of radiation.  Also useful for relaying Telemachus Data Link information.
		#ANTS-yagiAntenna-tags = phantom aerospace vhf aerial antenna radio signal transmi
